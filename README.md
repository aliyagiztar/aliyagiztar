âš¡ Fun fact **In the Dark Souls series, the iconic bonfires, which serve as a place of rest and recovery for players, were initially designed as "checkpoints" to regenerate health and magic. However, as the game's development progressed, their role expanded to become central points for character leveling, world exploration, and player resurrection, making them a fundamental and memorable aspect of the game's mechanics and lore.**
